# Ray Tracing in One Weekend
This is my Rust implementation of the ray tracer developed in [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series.

## TODOs
* Proper README
* Maybe a CI? Cargo test + clippy + fmt?
* Maybe benchmarking? Criterion or divan?
* Clean up + document existing code. I.e., add the clippy settings from rtlola project?
